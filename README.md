# French Conjugator

[![Code Review](http://www.zomis.net/codereview/shield/?qid=111847)](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/111847/75443)

Conjugation Script for all french verbs for my website.

It isn't finished yet.
I will add other languages like Spanish and Italian, when the script is ready.

I need help from you, so feel free, to take part.

I need a solution to change all my long arrays, where are all verbs, another array for the translation and many other group arrays.
This should all be in a database.

I had earlier done a simpler version of this work and it works, but I will change it with this new version, if it is ready:
